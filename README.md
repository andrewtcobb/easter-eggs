# Easter Eggs

This React component library contains a variety of different easter eggs you can add to a project with minimal effort.

Have you a ever wanted to add a flying beach ball to your app? You can add the `FLyingImage` component to your React app just like this:
```tsx
<FlyingImage />
```

Now your users can toggle this easter egg on and off with the shortcut you provide (`ctrl+shift+E` by default).
